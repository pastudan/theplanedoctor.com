        <h2>About Us - Bobbi Boucher </h2>
        <div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>The white, pink and gold RV-4 pictured below was built and test-flown by Bobbi Boucher over a
                        period of six years - all 14820 rivets; no quick-build for this girl! The plane first flew in
                        January 1998 and has since accumulated 402 hours. N2QT is powered by a 160 horsepower Lycoming
                        O-320 turning a fixed-pitch wooden two-blade propeller by Aymar-Demuth. Bobbi knows her engine
                        inside and out - she built it up herself.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Bobbi holds a Comercial Pilot certificate with ratings for Single and Multiengine Land and
                        Seaplanes, and is also a Certified Flight Instructor. She started out flying sailplanes, and
                        first soloed in 1973.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        She spent six years in the Navy working on P-3s, which enabled her to get her Airframe and
                        Powerplant ratings. Thanks to the Navy, she was also able to get her Flight Engineer
                        rating.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Bobbi also went to Africa at the request of the World Wildlife Foundation to build and fly a
                        Beaver RX 550 ultralight aircraft for the foundation.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        She has also done a firewall-forward Lancair 320, and has built a Super Lancair ES with an
                        IO-550 up front.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Bobbi has flown her RV-4 in five AirVenture Cup races, making her the most experienced female
                        pilot and solo pilot in AirVenture Cup history.<br/>
